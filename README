A wonderfully simple, no-nonsense countdown timer. Inspired by
the elegant simplicity of an old-fashioned egg timer, you just
turn the dial and the alarm is set! To cancel the alarm, just
turn it back down to zero.

The minimalist feature set is intentional, to keep the
features from getting in the way of what you are trying to get
done. You can however toggle the ringing and vibration.

that is included with the Android operating system. Therefore,
